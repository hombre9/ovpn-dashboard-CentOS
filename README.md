# ovpn-dashboard

Web frontend for openvpn server

Enables simple creation of client config files, either for dial-up or site-to-site scenarios, allows for certificate management/revoking, gives an overview of general system status and openVPN-specific information, enables easy backup/restore of server config file, and supports editing of your current server configuration (you will still need to restart the openvpn service after changing configuration, but you can do that from the web frontend as well)
